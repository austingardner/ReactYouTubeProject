# ReactYouTubeProject

This project calls the youtube api and embeds the video. The user can search youtube for any videos in the search bar on top and the top five results will appear, the highest one in the middle of the page. The others can be clicked on and switched between. 

I did this project in React. I did it with the help of a tutorial; however, I learned some very valuable things about React. 

I understand that each React component has its own state, but that this state is different from the redux state. This state can be initialized in the constructor with a this.state = {...} but later on the state of each component must only be modified through setState().
